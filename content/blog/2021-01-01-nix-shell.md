Nearly every software project depends on packages. Many of these packages are
provided by your programming language's build tool, and specified in a
configuration file (`package.json`, `Gemfile`, etc.).

This is ideal: those configuration files are checked into version control, and
your build tool will (hopefully) install those packages locally for your project
only.

However, any sufficiently complex project will also depend on external packages:
development tools, databases, C libraries... the list goes on. You could argue
even the projects using only language-specific libraries still need to get their
build tool and compiler/interpreter from somewhere!

These packages are usually provided by your operating system's package manager
(`brew`, `apt`, etc.), which installs them in a global context (either per-user
or system-wide).




system's package manager.

This can be problematic when you need
everyone on your team to use the same version of those packages.


The [Nix package manager / build tool][nix] provides the `nix-shell` command,
a tool which makes declaratively specifying development environments easy.

which starts an interactive shell with packages you specify in the `PATH`.

`nix-shell` makes it
easy to declaratively specify a development environment that is consistent
across space and time.

is easy to use but has a high power-to-weight ratio. It 

Proper use of the `nix-shell` tool guarantees all developers use the correct
version of your project's dependencies, no matter the state of their system.


## Ad-hoc

```shell
/tmp/nix-shell $ command -v node || echo "not installed"
not installed

/tmp/nix-shell $ command -v postgres || echo "not installed"
not installed

/tmp/nix-shell $ nix-shell --packages nodejs postgresql

[nix-shell:/tmp/nix-shell]$ command -v node
/nix/store/pjacii8rznr3igdv433a4na0g2y3nxxf-nodejs-14.15.3/bin/node

[nix-shell:/tmp/nix-shell]$ command -v postgres
/nix/store/gbsbv45rxklk3mhdld1dil5g142l9gr7-postgresql-11.10/bin/postgres

[nix-shell:/tmp/nix-shell]$ node --version
v14.15.3

[nix-shell:/tmp/nix-shell]$ postgres --version
postgres (PostgreSQL) 11.10

[nix-shell:/tmp/nix-shell]$ exit

/tmp/nix-shell $
```

## Basic

```nix
# shell.nix

let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};

in
  pkgs.mkShell {
    buildInputs = [
      pkgs.nodejs
      pkgs.postgresql
    ];
  }
```

## Pinned

```nix
# nixpkgs.nix

let
  # master on 2020-12-30
  rev = "9b78f36021b3530773c4a2136c26862d32aef3f6";

  nixpkgs =
    builtins.fetchTarball {
      name = "nixpkgs";
      url = "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/${rev}.tar.gz";
      sha256 = "1b2apazjm9n4phh6gvq9dw6x6ziklvvqahz7wy5gmbmyaxk8yf1g";
    };

in
  import nixpkgs
```

```nix
# shell.nix

let
  pkgs = import ./nixpkgs.nix {};

in
  pkgs.mkShell {
    buildInputs = [
      pkgs.nodejs
      pkgs.postgresql
    ];
  }
```

When updating the Git revision of your pinned Nixpkgs, the easiest way to
find the new SHA256 hash is by entering something wrong and waiting for Nix to
correct you. Attempting to enter the shell with the wrong hash will cause Nix to
complain and give you the right answer:

```
/tmp/nix-shell $ nix-shell
unpacking 'https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/014440d7105ce2be945b79dc957dd08720a9c029.tar.gz'...
error: hash mismatch in file downloaded from 'https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/014440d7105ce2be945b79dc957dd08720a9c029.tar.gz':
  wanted: sha256:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  got:    sha256:0wp96yyjly3m46r6xp239q6xy1iwbg5nyqih7g2k2m17bi3pbi9r
